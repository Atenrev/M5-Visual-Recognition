Welcome to the README of the `Analyzing the Capabilities of Visual Recognition Systems in Autonomous Driving and in Out-of-Domain Scenarios` project within _Module 5: Visual Recognition_ of the Master's program in Computer Vision at UAB. This repository contains the relevant code for this project.

## Introduction

Object detection and segmentation are dynamic research fields within computer vision, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) serve as the foundation for many advanced visual recognition methods. In this project, we focus on two CNN-based models: Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN.

The primary aim of this master module is to comprehensively study the behavior of various configurations of RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN (implemented using Detectron2). We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on datasets such as KITTI-MOTS, MOTSChallenge, and out-of-context datasets.

Throughout this project, we explore the capabilities of Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN as off-the-shelf and finetunable models. Additionally, we investigate their generalization abilities in out-of-context and low co-occurrence settings. Notably, our findings indicate a tendency of convolutional networks to exhibit texture bias.

## Project Deliverables
The module consists of five distinct deliveries that collectively form a complete pipeline. Each week's delivery encompasses specific aspects and code implementations. For further details, requirements, and the complete code of each week, please refer to the respective README.md file.
